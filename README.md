# 🏛️ Centroid Pyramid in C

A unique twist on the classic Mario pyramid — this program builds a **symmetrical pyramid with a central spine**.
Instead of leaving a gap between two halves, the pyramid fuses together at the centroid, creating a bold and balanced structure.

## 📖 Description
The program prompts the user for a height and constructs a pyramid pattern using nested loops.
Each row is aligned with spaces, left hashes, a central hash, and right hashes.
The result is a **centroid pyramid** — a design that emphasizes symmetry and strength.

This project reflects my experimentation with loops, conditionals, and creative problem‑solving in C.
It’s not just a solution; it’s my own invention, prototyped in 30 seconds and refined with logic.

## ✨ Features
- Input prompt for pyramid height
- Dynamic pyramid scaling based on user input
- Nested loops for spaces and hashes
- Central spine (`?`) for a fused pyramid look
- Clean, structured output

## 👨‍💻 Author's Note
This centroid pyramid is my personal remix of the Mario challenge.
By adding a central spine, I transformed the double pyramid into a single, unified structure.
It may look simple, but it represents my creativity, speed in prototyping, and confidence in experimenting with C.
